# ancientwasm
ancientwasm is a container for compiling ancient COBOL and/or FORTRAN into webassembly without the hassle of setting up your own environment.

Some example COBOL and FORTRAN code is provided in the container at /root/example.

Once the container is built, run example.sh inside the container to compile and execute the example code.
