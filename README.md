# ancientwasm
ancientwasm is a container for compiling *ancient* COBOL and/or FORTRAN into webassembly without the hassle of setting up your own environment.

Some example COBOL and FORTRAN code is provided in the container at /root/demo1 and /root/demo2.

Once the container is built, attach with the -a flag and enter the directory of the demo you wish to execute. Run demo.sh in order to compile and execute the example code.
